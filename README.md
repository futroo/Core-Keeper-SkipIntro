## Introduction

Skip Intro - as the name suggests, allows you to avoid the wait for the Pugstorm and Fireshine Games initial logos.  This helps the game to load faster. It can be useful during mod testing or for impatient individuals. Now you can start your adventure before you even manage to say "SkipIntro"!

## Installation

To install Skip Intro you need to find the mod in the Mods menu in the game, and then subscribe to it.
